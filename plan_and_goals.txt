Goals:
- Try to build something w as little coding as possible
- Have a calendar with a plan for what I need to do when

MVP User Stories:
- I can add a task
  - Each task should have a name and a description
- I can ask an AI to sort all of my tasks into a planting calendar
  - Fetch all of the tasks from the database, interpret their descriptions
  - Pass all of their descriptions and names into the AI along with a prompt requesting a general plan and timeline
  - AI returns a plan
  - Plan is converted to a calendar structure
- I can edit, delete, or mark a task complete
- I can send a custom request to my AI asking it to update the calendar according to some extra criteria
- I can view all of my tasks in some sort of time-based view. This might be a calendar widget, or could be as simple as a table with dates

Structure:
- DB (initially SQLite local is fine)
- NextJS app? Why NextJS?

Post-MVP ideas:
- Calendar integrates with my gcal, suggests things by weekend
- Integrate with weather forecast?
- Deploy somewhere that Suzanne can access (rpi?)
